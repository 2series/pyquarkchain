Coding Style of pyquarkchain projet

=============
General Rules

We use PEP8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ as our general rules for coding style.  For sublime, we sugguest to use Anaconda package.

======
Naming

We use mix Java and C style naming:
- Package name is lower case with underscore between words
- Class name: the first letter of each word is upper case
- Method name: the first word is lower case, and the first letters of the rest words are upper case
- Constant: All words are upper case and separated by underscore
- Global function: all words are lower case and separated by underscore
- Local variable: the same as class method
