Coding Style of pyquarkchain project

=============
General Rules

We use PEP8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ as our general rules for coding style.
For sublime, we suggest to use Anaconda package.

======
Naming

We use mix Java and C style naming:
- Package name: lower_case_with_underscore
- Class name: UpperCamelCase
- Method name: lowerCamelCase
- Constant: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE
- Global function: lower_case_with_underscore
- Local variable: lowerCamelCase

==========
Line Width

We use 120 max chars per line instead of 80 chars.
For sublime with Anaconda, we could set

"pep8_max_line_length": 120

in settings.
