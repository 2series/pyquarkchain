How to create a single-node system
==========================
1, Run the node
$ python3 simple_network.py --server_port=38291 --enable_local_server=true

2, Run traffic generator
$ python3 testnet/tx_generator_with_miner.py --genesis_key=c987d4506fb6824639f9a9e3b8834584f5165e94680501d1b0044071cd36c3b3

where
- genesis_key is the private key associated with the account of genesis block

3, (Optional) Observe TPS
$ python3 jrpc_client.py --method=getStats --times=10000000

Performance Optimization
------------------------
The default setup (e.g., 16 shards, 4K TXs per block, and 3 seconds per block) should be able to deliver 16 * 4K / 3 = 21K TPS.  However, the performance may be much lower mainly because of CPU limit.  There are a couple of optimizations to improve that:
- Make sure to use taskset to put the node and traffic generator in different CPU cores as both of them are very CPU-intensive
- Make sure to install coincurve as the default python implementation of ECDSA algorithm is very slow

With these two optimizations, I could get more than 3K+ TPS on my i7-7700K machine.

In the future:
- We will enable multi-threading handling of each shard on different cores
- The performance can be further improved by using GPU
